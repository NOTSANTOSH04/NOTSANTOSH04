## 🔭 About Me
I’m a Computer Science & AI undergrad at **Amrita School of Engineering** (CGPA: 7.9) with a passion for building ML systems and creative hardware projects. I love turning data and sensors into intelligible, usable systems — whether that’s a model that learns pronunciation or an IoT shoe that knows when you’re walking too hard. I enjoy hackathons, learning new frameworks, and creating practical solutions to curious problems.
